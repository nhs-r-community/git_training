# git_training

Welcome to the NHS-R community repository for Git Training. Code version control is fundamental skill for any analysts, as it provides tonnes of benefits for both you and your project.

### Instructions for Codespaces
1. Create your repository as a first step in practising using repositories, [How to create a new repository.](./guides/how_to_create_a_repo.md)
2. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository.
3. Start [a new Codespaces session](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository#creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository) with your forked repository and follow the steps in our [guide to Git](./guides/introduction_to_git.md) (see [here](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/git/intro-to-git/) for an equivalent guide for Python users or see below for R!).

### Instructions if you're not using Codespaces
1. Download [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and [RStudio desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) or create an account on [RStudio cloud](https://login.rstudio.cloud/login?redirect=%2F).
2. Install Git via this [link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), ONLY if you are using RStudio desktop.
3. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository, then git clone your forked repository or create a [new repository.](./guides/how_to_create_a_repo.md) It's recommended to practice first by forking and cloning this repository.
4. Follow the steps in our [guide to git for R users](./guides/introduction_to_git.md) (see [here](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/git/introduction-to-git/) for an equivalent guide for Python users).


### Next steps:

* For more information about connecting to Git via RStudio, troubleshooting tips and Git/R features, we'd recommend [this guide](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html).
* **Practice**. After completing the [introduction to Git and version control guide](./guides/introduction_to_git.md), feel free to practice version control by making changes to the files in the practice_scripts folder (add, remove or edit files) and then follow the Git commands workflow to push these changes to your branch for this repository on GitHub.
