> This is the README.md file. GitHub (or GitLab) will open this file as a landing page whenever the file is present. This could either be the repository's top level or a folder containing a README.md. In this repo, there's one on the top level, one in the Exercises folder and one in the Guides folder.

Feel free to practice with adding, deleting or editing the above files, then following the [standard git command workflow](../guides/introduction_to_git.md#5-commit-your-changes-follow-standard-git-command-workflow) to push these changes to your branch.

You can also either run an [R script](./example_r_script.r) and/or a [Python script](./example_python_convert_fahrenheit.py) should you wish to practice developing code using version control.
