# How to create a repository on GitHub

This guide will show you how to create a repository on GitHub:

#### 1. Log in your GitHub account (or create one).
#### 2. Click on the plus icon, located right next to your profile picture on the top right.
#### 3. You will be presented with a few options, unless you're importing a template repository, opt for "New repository".
#### 4. Entering the "New repository" screen:
* Select an Owner, this can be you (so your GitHub account) or if you are part of an Organisation on GitHub (so your workplace or an University Organisation group etc.).
* Name the repository, usually the format will be something like "my-project". See GitHub's [guide](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Gov-Org-HowTo/Naming-Repos.md).
* Add a (optional) description of your project.
* Decide on the visibility setting of your project: Public/Private or Enterprise/Internal (business visibility, available if the repository's Owner is your Organisation).
* Choose having a README, a licence and/or a [.gitignore file](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/git_training/blob/hr_update/guides/intro_to_git.md#general-the-gitignore-file). Each option has a "Learn more" tag to understand each item's purpose.
#### 5. Once happy with your choices, click "Create repository".
